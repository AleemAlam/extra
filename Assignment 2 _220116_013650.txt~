9uestion 1 )
1. Descriptive and Inferential statistics
is presented in the report.
Level of measurements used are nominal(grouping) , ordinaI(order) , interval(equal intervals) and 
ratio .
2. The data given in the report are estimates as whenever we conduct research about a group of 
people, it's rarely possible to collect data from every person in that group. Instead, we select a 
sample. The sample is the group of individuals who will actually participate in the research.To 
draw valid conclusions from our results, we have to carefully decide how we will select a sample 
that is representative of the group as a whole.
3. There are several ways in which the
researchers may have collected the

data . The most popular ways are
surveys , polls and interviews .
They might have also used secondary data such as records kept by the government.

4. There is potential for a wide variety of statistics to be gathered that represent several levels 
of
data. For example, ratio-level measurements on items such as income, number of children, age of 
household heads,
number of livestock, and grams of
toothpaste consumed per
year might be obtained. On the other hand, if researchers use
a Likert scale (1-to-5 measurements) to
gather responses
about the interests, likes, and

preferences of rural India con- sumers, an ordinal-level measurement would be obtained,
as would the ranking of products or
brands in market
research studies. Other variables, such
as geographic loca-
tion, sex, occupation, or religion, are
usually measured with
nominal data.


5. The managers can use the given Statistics to describe markets, inform advertising, set prices 
and respond to changes in consumer demand. Morever by analyzing the trend in the given Statistics, 
managers can predict future business practices , determine indicators, compare them, and help

identify the ways to succeed in the rural
market place .




9uestion 2)
a. The population in interest are the 20000 Toyota Customers who bought Camry cars from the given 
dealership last year .

b. The variable of interest is the satisfaction level of the customers who bought Camry cars.

c. The sample is 3000 customers to whom questionnaires were sent at random .

d. At random here means that each of the 20000 customer had an equal probability of being selected 
to answer the questionnaire so that the company can get an unbiased representation of the total 
population.



9uestion 3)
a. The population is the list of fortune
500 companies .

b. Variable of interest is the number of new graduates that the Fortune 500 companies intend to 
hire in the coming year.


c. Sample is the 70 companies out of

500 whose representatives were asked how many college graduates their company is likely to
hire in the following year.

The sample may have been selected by random sampling( each member of the population has an equal 
chance, or probability, of being selected) or convenience sampling (based on availability and 
willingness of representatives to answer the question).

d. While descriptive
statistics summarize the characteristics of a data set, inferential statistics help us come to 
conclusions and make predictions based on our data.

When we have collected data from

a sample, we can use inferential statistics to understand the larger population from which the 
sample is taken.
When analysing data, such as the marks achieved by 100 students for a piece of coursework, it is 
possible to use both descriptive and inferential statistics in your analysis of their marks. 
Typically, in most research conducted on groups of people, we will use both descriptive and 
inferential statistics to analyse our results and draw conclusions.
